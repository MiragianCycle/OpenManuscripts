* Prompt 1: A Novel About Vim

- **Idea**: 
A re-imagining of Moses receiving the Ten Commandments, but instead of the Commandments in the form of a stone tablet, it's a computer terminal opened on Vim - he doesn't know how to quit! - and this protagonist has to figure out how to unravel these commandments.
