# Open Stories 
**Version 0.1**

## INTRODUCTION
The Open Manuscript project is a collaborative writing community, guided by the principles of other open knowledge movements. The aim of the project is to allow writers to tackle **Open Prompts** (essentially writing prompts from around the web) together in a inclusive, collaborative, diverse and welcoming space. Writers can contribute in a variety of ways - either as a *Writer* or as an *Editor* - using the version control system known as [Git](https://git-scm.com/), or making simple first [pull requests](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/). This is an excellent [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ).

Every week, I ([MiragianCycle](https://theena.net/)), will attempt a short story based on a prompt. The entire writing session will be recorded, sans voice, and made available on YouTube; the manuscript for each prompt then made available on this repo. 

Writers are free to take these manuscripts, and change it as they wish. My hope is that this combination on fly-on-the-wall approach to seeing a writer at work, and then being able to access, read, edit, and take ownership of the respective manuscript, would be educational to young writers embarking on their first projects. In the long run, I hope it leads to a form of *open story-telling*.  

## WHY? 

There are two good reasons why this project was started: 

- Pragmatic: First attempts at any type of creative work is difficult. Beginning artists have a world world of visual material available free, beginning coders have entire code libraries accessible for free on places such as GitHub. It shouldn't be that hard to have similar starter material for writers. Ergo, **Open Manuscripts** 
- Philosophical: I truly believe the publishing industry's approach to protecting its intellectual property will lead, in the long term, to writing being relegated as a creative expression, losing out to other creative avenues that are less restrictive. This is no place for a ramble, but I will add that this is a humble attempt at exploring alternative ways of thinking about ownership of written works. 


## WHO IS THIS FOR? 

At this early stage, I imagine the audience for this project belong to one of the four categories: 

- Experienced writers, embarking on their first writing projects 
- Voracious readers who want to channel their love of words into writing 
- Regular contributors to fan fiction. We know how much these words on pages, the worlds they conjure, the people that populate them, mean to you. We also see how [dismissively](https://winteriscoming.net/2019/11/10/george-rr-martin-fanfiction-explanation/) and [condescendingly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2017/02/10/fifty-shades-of-green-how-fanfiction-went-from-dirty-little-secret-to-money-machine/?sh=1be5a002264c)you are treated by the publishers and authors who would stand to benefit the most by allowing you to take ownership of some of these stories. You may not yet be 'fans' of any of the stories here, but you are welcome to take them and mould these narratives to your heart's content. 
- Storytellers of other sorts looking for inspiration and collaboration from fresh new writing voices
