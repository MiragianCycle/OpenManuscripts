## Weekly Prompts and Manuscripts

Every week, ([I](https://theena.net/)) craft a short story based on a prompt. The writing sessions are recorded without voice and shared on YouTube, while the manuscript (in markdown, LaTeX, PDF and HTML formats) is made available here.

## Why Open Stories?

This project serves two purposes:

- **Pragmatic Approach:** Just as artists and coders have accessible resources, we believe writers should have open starter material. Hence, **Open Manuscripts**.
- **Philosophical Stand:** We challenge the conventional approach to intellectual property in publishing. Our aim is to explore alternative ownership concepts for written works.

## Who's Invited?

This project is designed for:

- New writers starting their creative journeys
- Avid readers transitioning into writing
- Fans of fan fiction seeking a space to shape stories without limitations
- Storytellers seeking inspiration and collaboration
