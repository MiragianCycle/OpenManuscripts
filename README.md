# Open Manuscripts

## INTRODUCTION
The Open Manuscript project is a collaborative writing community, guided by the principles of other open knowledge movements. The aim of the project is to allow writers to tackle **Open Prompts** (essentially writing prompts from around the web) together in a inclusive, collaborative, diverse and welcoming space. Writers can contribute in a variety of ways - either as a *Writer* or as an *Editor* - using the version control system known as [Git](https://git-scm.com/), or making simple first [pull requests](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/) This is an excellent [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ).

Every week, I ([MiragianCycle](https://theena.net/), will attempt a short story based on a prompt. The entire writing session will be recorded, sans voice, and made available on YouTube; the manuscript for each prompt then made available on this repo. Writers are free to take these manuscripts, and change it as they wish. My hope is that this combination on fly-on-the-wall approach to seeing a writer at work, and then being able to access, read, edit, and take ownership of the respective manuscript, would lead to a form of *open story-telling*. 

## WHY 

There are two good reasons why this project was started: 

- Pragmatic: First attempts at any type of creative work is difficult. Beginning artists have a world world of visual material available free, beginning coders have entire code libraries accessible for free on places such as GitHub. It shouldn't be that hard to have similar starter material for writers. Ergo, **Open Manuscripts** 
- Philosophical: I truly believe the publishing industry's approach to protecting its intellectual property will lead, in the long term, to writing being relegated as a creative expression, losing out to other creative avenues that are less restrictive. This is no place for a ramble, but I will add that this is a humble attempt at exploring alternative way of looking at written works.
